# My Portfolio

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create a Portfolio page that will showcase my work as I progress through this bootcamp and as I enter my future career in front-end development. In addition to this, the aim was to utlise additional skills such as CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid and Media Queries to create a web page that was responsive to different screen sizes as well as creating higher quality designs. Throughout this project I have learnt the following:
- How to implement css media queries to create responsive web pages.
- How CSS Flexbox and Grid can be used to create multiple layouts and designs.

## Usage
The portfolio web page has three main navigational links:
- About Me
- My Work
- Contact Me

This can be seen in the screenshot below:

When each navigational link is clicked, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the webpage as shown below:

CSS Grid has been used to create a tiled effect for examples of work. The main placeholder (Horiseon) also operates as a link to a deployed web page whilst the rest are placeholders for the time being.

Within the "Contact Me" section of the webpage, there are two functional links:
- Email Address
- GitHub Profile

When the email address link is clicked, an email window will open where an email can be sent as seen below:

When the GitHub Profile link is clicked, the user will be taken to my GitHub Profile.

Media queries have been used to make the page responsive when accessed on a different sized screen. I have done this to the following width boundaries:
- Minimum Width = 648 pixels
- Maximum Width = 1000 pixels
